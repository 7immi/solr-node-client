##Documentation

See the website at http://lbdremy.github.com/solr-node-client/.

##Usage

```js
// Load dependency
var solr = require('solr-client');

// Create a client
var client = solr.createClient();

// Add a new document
client.add({ id : 12, title_t : 'Hello' },function(err,obj){
   if(err){
      console.log(err);
   }else{
      console.log('Solr response:', obj);
   }
});
```

##Migration between 0.2.x and 0.3.x

The only breaking change introduced in `v0.3.0` is about method chaining of the solr `Client`.
Method chaining as simply been removed because we were actually hidding something really interesting and useful
the `http.ClientRequest` instance.

So, before you could have done this:

```js
var client = solr.createClient();

client
	.search('q=hello', function(err, obj){
		console.log(err, obj);
	})
	.search('q=world', function(err, obj){
		console.log(err, obj);
	});
```

Now it won't work, but you have now access to the `http.ClientRequest` instead created by `Client#search`:

```js
var client = solr.createClient();

var request = client.search('q=hello', function(err, obj){
	console.log(err, obj);
});
request.setTimeout(200, function(){
	console.log('search timeout');
});
```

Post an issue if you have troubles migrating to v0.3.0.

##Roadmap

###v0.3.x

- Test suite with mocha and chai instead of vows
- Implement all features available in Solr 4 (SolrCloud API in particular)
- Provide all low-level commands
- Complete documentation

###v1.0.x

- First stable version
- the API is frozen until v2.0.x, only new features and bug fixes can be introduced

##Test

```
npm test
```

Tests are executed against a running SOLR instance, so you might want to:
- install the schema.xml and solrconfig.xml expected by the tests. You find these in test/materials
- make sure your solr instance is running
- specifiy non-default connection params to your server in test/config.json You can inject these also on the command line through:

```
mocha test/*-test.js --client.core=test-node-client --client.port=8080
```

## Test coverage

Before to be able to run the command below, you will need to install jscoverage available here https://github.com/visionmedia/node-jscoverage.

```
npm run-script test-cov
```

This command will generate a file named `coverage.html`, use your browser to visualize it.

## Static analysis and complexity report

```
npm run-script report
```
